    <h1>HW 1 Submission</h1>
    <p>From this class, I hope to gain a better understanding of 
    the <em>Web Development process</em>. I also am interested to see how the skills I gain
    from this class apply to the real world. I am also hoping to simply
    have <strong>fun</strong> and learn more about Computer Science. I do not take Computer
    Science too seriously (aka it won't be my job in the future), so I 
    try to use it has a creative outlet of sorts. I enjoy how computer science makes me think 
    differently about how to solve problems.</p>
