    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kylie Alfaro! I am a Senior studying 
    Biochemistry and Computer Science at Gonzaga Univesity. In my day to day, I work
    as a teaching assistant in multiple different academic departments, while 
    taking a variety of courses. I am also heavily involved in Undergraduate Research.
    My current project includes studying phosphorus asscociation with sediment
    in freshwater systems. Phosphorus, in excess, can lead to eutrophication which 
    lowers water quality. By studying phosphorus asscociation, we can better understand
    where the phosphorus is coming from.</p>
